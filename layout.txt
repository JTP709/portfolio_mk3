	h3>FRONT END APPLICITY</h3>
    	<p class="text-muted text-a-font text-left">You're probably thinking "This guy doesn't know how to spell!" or "Is 'Applicity' really a word?" No need to reach for your dictionary, it isn't a real word. It's simply my approach to front-end design. I believe that applicable simplicity should drive design. End-users don't want to spend time trying to figure out how to use an application when they need to be putting that app to use!</p>
	<h3>BACK END EFFECIENCY</h3>
		<p class="text-muted text-left text-a-font">A lot goes on behind the scenes to keep your app moving. Anyting that takes longer than 3 seconds to load is unacceptable. I implement the latest programming paradigms to grease the gears ensure your server is high speed, low drag.</p>
	<h3>EXPRESSION OR IMAGINATION?</h3>
        <p class="text-muted text-a-font text-left">My work is where the right brain and left brain come together. Understanding the logic behind the science of our world allows me to explore the limits of human creativity.</p>
	h3>ENGINEERED WITH LOVE</h3>
        <p class="text-muted text-a-font text-left">Isn't it love that makes you - er, i mean us - human?</p>
